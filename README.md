# 📣 MicroMatch – The Micro Influencer Marketing Platform

**MicroMatch** is a full-stack influencer marketing platform that connects businesses with **multiple micro influencers** for targeted, authentic, and cost-effective promotional campaigns.

## 💡 Why Micro Influencers?

Traditional influencer marketing often relies on macro influencers with large followings. While effective, this can be **expensive and less engaging** for niche audiences.

Micro influencers, on the other hand:
- Have **higher engagement rates** with their followers
- Offer **authentic brand alignment**
- Are **more affordable**, making it viable to **collaborate with multiple influencers** instead of just one

This makes campaigns **more diverse, locally targeted**, and statistically more impactful.
